          My name is Bryce Willey. I am a clinical fellow with the Suffolk LIT lab, and for the past two and
          a half years, I have been learning Docassemble, and hacking on the internals:

        <aside class="notes">
          So to start off, why should you hack on docassemble internals?
      
          There are a lot of reasons to do so. First, there are bugs in docassemble. 
          It's a big program, does a ton of things, and
          sometimes bugs slip in. If you find them, you can fix them yourself; there's nothing
          stopping you. It definitely would help out
          Jonathan Pyle (the creator of docassemble), and save him from having fix them himself. 

          Additionally, you can add new features or improve the docassemble playground, improving the authoring experience.

          As you hack on Docassemble and look around the code, you'll learn how docassemble works.
          You'll pull back the curtain and see that it's really just a lot of python, like 
          you're using in your docassemble interviews. The more knowledge you have about how docassemble is running internally,
          the better a developer you can be.

          Anytime you like make your changes, you can contribute them
          back to the main code base. Then everyone in the docassemble community can benefit from your work.
          
          Lastly, I just think it's just fun to hack around. It has the same kind of tangible
          experience of writing a docassemble interview or running a simple program, and seeing your code working and running. 
          It's exciting!

        <img class="r-stretch" src="assets/cat_firehose.svg"
          alt="The docassemble cat with a red fire hose, spraying a forceful blast of water" />
        <p>Don't memorize all of this: it's <a href="https://docassemble.org/docs/development.html#core">in the docs</a>
        </p>
        <aside class="notes">
          Docassemble is a really big
          piece of software, and has a lot of different moving parts, so this presentation is going to be a fire hose. When I
          first ran through these slides, it took about 45 minutes. I do not have 45 minutes now! So there's a lot of
          things that I'm going to try and skim over. Hopefully it's still understandable to most folks; if not don't
          worry. Don't try to memorize any of this; all of these concrete steps are in the documentation, so you can always go back
          walk through these specific steps. Even if you walk away only remembering one new thing from this presentation,
          then this presentation was a success.

          <h2>Some starting assumptions:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0"><a
                href="https://docassemble.org/docs/helloworld.html">docassemble</a></li>

            <!--li>git?</li-->
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
           So a few things I'm going to assume you, the reader, have;
           <ul>
            <li>
           some experience with docassemble. If you've written a docassemble interview, administered a docassemble server, or ran
           your own docassemble server, it helps to sort of have somebody have a bit of background knowledge on just what
           docassemble is.
            </li>
            <li>
          a little bit of python knowledge; if you've made a
          docassemble interview, you probably know enough; If you know what a variable is and you know how to
          call a function, you know enough to start poking around docassemble's code. You won't know
          everything, but that's okay.
            </li>
            <li>
          knowledge about how files and folders are structured on computers
            </li>
           </ul>
          If you don't have any of these starting assumptions, don't worry. All of the links in these slides will 
          help you starting out.

            <img height="500" src="assets/vscode.png" alt="A screenshot of visual studio code editor">
            <aside class="notes">
          The first thing you want to do when hacking on docassemble is install an
          editor. You can do it in something as simple as notepad, but I recommend VS code. It's still very bare bones. But it has a
          large community around it, and there are like a lot of tutorials on how to get started.

          <h2>The Terminal</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Linux and Mac can use your <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac">default terminal programs</a></li>
            <li>Windows:<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">Setup WSL 2</a></li>
          </ul>
          <img src="assets/Capture.PNG" alt="A screenshot of the Windows terminal, with the message 'Hello Docacon!'">
        <aside class="notes">
          Next you'll need a terminal to run the commands to start, restart, and update docassemble. On
          Linux and Mac you can use your default terminals, and on Windows I highly recommend setting up WSL 2,
          which stands for "Windows subsystem for Linux" (it just runs Linux on Windows, which is very nice). It's
          what I'll be using for this presentation.

        <section>
            <h2>Download Docassemble</h2>
            <pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="language-bash">
              # If on WSL2 or Linux (no need on Mac)
              sudo apt install git
              git clone https://github.com/jhpyle/docassemble
            </code></pre>
        <aside class="notes">
          The first thing you'll do is download docassemble.
          If you're on Linux or WSL 2, the first command installs git, which is the "git" in
          GitHub. For our purposes, git is a tool for getting the code from GitHub onto your
          machine. The "clone" command does just that. It'll grab all of docassemble source code from GitHub and just
          download it to your machine.

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          We'll start with it already installed and the docker container running, but still talk about these here.
          Once we have all the that code on a machine we need to actually run it and make sure anything we change on
          that code will be reflected and in docassemble.So we're first going to set up Docker. Docker has a whole bunch
          of ways to set it up (instructions all linked here again). If you're on Windows which I will be as I am um I I
          and if you're using WSL too like I'm recommending um you can just follow the instructions for installing
          Docker on Ubuntu and it's pretty straightforward there's also an option for Docker desktop which is a little
          bit easier to approach it's sort of a normal program, that you might run on your Windows machine
          but you got to be a bit careful because it has a few terms; you have to be a small company like under 250
          people or make like less than some amount I don't remember the exact amount of money per year otherwise it's
          not free and you have to suddenly start paying for it. So you have to sort of be aware of that but either
          either works and if you're a smaller company or it's just you you're totally fine to use Docker desktop as
          well.

          So what even is Docker? If you've ever run docassemble you've probably run some of these commands and
          you might not have any idea what they're doing um which is fair because
          Docker is really kind of complicated. But we can break it down and we'll start off with just knowing that
          Docker is a (not exactly technically correct) but it's very similar to a virtual machine. so if you've ever
          run um run something like Virtualbox or VMware or bootcamp on your Mac
          um where you're running a Windows machine inside of your own computer so it's just a little like Inception
          where you're running a computer on your computer and Docker is essentially doing the same thing; it's running
          a different computer on your own computer.
          And specifically we call that little running computer that's inside of your own a container. And I'll try and
          use that now so I don't have to say computer 20 times. There's also something called an image, which is all of
          the files that you need to actually run that container. So on this machine which is the presenters machine, I
          can open File Explorer and I can go to my C drive and this is every single file on on this computer. And
          that's really just all
          an image is, it's every single file that you need to run um that you need to run the container somewhere else
          that you can download and it can be stored on your computer somewhere. But it's just every single file you
          need finally there's a volume and there are a few different types of volumes in Docker but the one we're going
          to use is a bit like a flash drive so same way in a flash drive you can plug it into your computer and you can
          see some more additional files that aren't stored on your computer but are stored somewhere else. In a similar
          way, a Docker volume is like a little flash drive
          that you can plug into the container and access some files from somewhere else in this case it'll be files on
          the on our main computer that the container can just access from there and only those specific files.

          So now
          that we've figured out a bit of what Docker is and we've installed our docassemble source code, we can
          actually run Docker. So this First Command (docker pull) will download the docker image onto your container.
          So remember that's all of the files that you'll need to run docassemble. And then this next command
          actually starts the container; you can ignore about most of this.
          You'll still need it but you don't really need to understand it. But there are a few important parts; the
          first one is that we're going to name our container. Docker lets you give things names. The names it gives
          them by default are okay, but they're like combinations of adjectives and scientists and it's just confusing
          and they change every time. So we're going to name ours
          mydocassemble. And then this next line that I'm highlighting, line seven, is the actual volume. So you don't
          have to quite know the syntax yet, but on this left side that's the docassemble folder that's the folder that
          we downloaded a few screens ago when we ran git clone. And going back um on the right side slash temp slash
          docassemble. That's just a folder inside of the docassemble container that now has all the all the files on
          your computer under the docassemble folder.

        <h2>Our change: <span class="hacker">more logs</span></h2>
        <img height="500" src="assets/logs-page-pre.png">
        <aside class="notes">
          So now that we've now that we have everything set up,
          we're gonna we're gonna run wild and do a live demo. I'm gonna do my share my whole screen

            So first off we'll go ahead and, let's figure out something to actually change
            on docassemble we'll first

            um to make it sort of a bit simple, if you've ever used docassemble, you've probably looked at the logs at
            some point. The logs are really useful and they tell you like what's going on if something ever goes wrong
            on docs- yes, is something not sharing? sorry [incomprehensible from audience] okay and yes this should be
            sharing on the Zoom. um cool sorry we are actually screen sharing. So but yeah if you've ever used the
            docassemble server you've probably looked at the logs before um and it shows the last 30 Lines by default.
            Let's say we want to change that to 60.
            So a really simple change it might be, it might be a bit useful if we don't have to always download the
            whole file to look at a bit more lines. And it's pretty straightforward,

          <h2>The Key components to <span class="hacker">hacking</span></h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Exploring and Navigating the code</li>
            <li>reading the code</li>

          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
             but first off we
            have to actually figure where figure out where in docasemble to make this change.And this is where I had um
            this is where I want us to if you if you take away one thing from this um one thing from this presentation I
            want you to take away the three components of hacking which are exploring and navigating the code, reading
            the code, and then making a
            really surgical small change that you need to. And just repeating all of those each of those three things
            and the one that's really daunting in my opinion is exploring and navigating the code

          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            so let's go ahead and
            I've got docassemble installed or downloaded from git onto my machine I'm going to go ahead and open up my
            copy of VS Code
            and we'll and then if you've if you've ever looked around in the docassemble source code, there's just a lot
            of it. And again, docassemble is a really big program; it's doing a lot of different things. And it can be
            really intimidating to figure out what's happening where and where are all of these, like where's the exact,
            what's happening when I visit logs the logs URL on docassemble where what code's running when I do that. And
            the key a key thing that I use all the time when I'm trying to patch things in
            docassemble is whatever page I'm on I look for some bit of text that could show me that it's likely in the
            source code. So we see this last, this last line, "only the last 30 lines are shown", if that's being shown
            on the screen, it's somewhere in the code likely. Especially this very specific text line. So let's go ahead
            and, in visual Visual Studio just expand that out a bit, Let's search for only the last 30 lines.
            So we can see, we come up with a few different results and this happens a lot; you're never going to find
            only the one, you're rarely
            going to find only the one place that this particular thing is in the code. But if you kind of glance around
            at these first results you'll see: okay there's English text on the right and oh there's German on the left
            and this is the translation file. And if you're searching for things that show up on the um show up in the
            UI you'll see a lot of results from different translation files in Spanish and German etc. but you keep
            going and sort of glance through all of them you'll see one that is very useful that is logs.html and and
            HTML is the thing that you're looking at in your browser so we have found it; we have found the page that
            actually is displaying the logs. And that's and that's sort of the main like a main way that you can go
            about navigating code like this. (starting to get a bit of an echo) Um so yeah and so and so now but now we
            now we have word blogs.html is but we need to figure out where there's
            this is just an HTML file and it has it has a few things if you've ever um edited a DOCX template and
            docassemble, you'll you'll see these sort of two curly braces looks pretty similar and that's because the
            HTML is using the same templating language Jinja as the DOCX template as as your DOCX templates are and so
            it's a lot more familiar than you might think um but we still need to figure out where the python code
            actually is that uses this logs.html. So we're going to use our secret trick again and we're going to search
            for logs.html
            And this time we're a lot luckier! There's one place that logs.html is in the source code um and it's in
            this fairly long function, but if we scroll to the top we do see it's just the python function. Like um if
            you've like and if you if we know we know how python functions work; you call them and you return something
            and that's all that's happening here, is there's flask which is what docassemble is running on whenever you
            visit that particular URL in your server flask calls the function for you, and then returns the actual HTML
            to show to the user.
            And we can see right at the very bottom, render_templates if we noticed back on this page the right above
            only the last 30 lines is all of the actual logs that we're looking at. All of these are the actual logs
            that we want to change what's being shown there. And so right above this is this text area and this jinja
            template that uses the variable content.
            We go back to our to our function that's a running when we visit logs, we see that
            the content content variable is being set to content. We can sort of go up a bit we can see that there's
            just a variable in this in this python function that's being set to content backtrack a little bit more we
            can see that lines is being used to set that variable, and so you can essentially look up and see: oh here's
            something called Tailer, tailer.tail opens a file and notably there's the number 30 a few different times.
            This is our line! And this is sort of the best way that I sort of you find what you find what you want in
            the
            docassemble code you sort of follow the string one line at a time. And it's really intimidating to open a
            twenty two thousand line long file, but just focus on the stuff the few lines that you're interested in
            you're good to go. So let's make our change so we wanted to show a bit more than 30 lines let's show 60
            lines instead so we'll change that 30 to 60. and then we'll actually go back into the logs HTML and we'll
            say
            that we're we'll tell people that we're showing 60 lines instead as well.

                docker exec -it mydocassemble /bin/bash

          The prompt will change to "root@a54e5b3:/#"
          <pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="language-bash">

                cd /tmp/docassemble

            </code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">

            And so now that we've made our change in docassemble, we need to actually run those changes um and update
            our running server to use those changes. These are and this is sort of a bit more of Bash, so a bit more
            command line terminal commands we're going to run um and you can copy those you can copy those right now,
            but essentially they're just making another terminal inside of the docker container that we're already
            running. So mydocassemble and bash. And if you notice you don't have I'm skipping over a lot of terminal
            stuff right now so don't worry um but if you notice the left side it used to say brycew@lt-bwilley, just the
            name of my laptop from Suffolk, and it now says root@this really weird string. That just means we're now
            inside of our
            running our our container, which remember is a different computer, so of course it's going to say it's a
            different computer than my laptop. And once we're here we'll run those few other commands which we need to.
            Which we need to actually sort of just tell our terminal, "hey we're going to be using this version of
            python and we're going to go over to this particular folder and from there we're going to copy these these
            last two commands are the most important and they are this pip install which actually updates-
            okay just do it there um- this pip install command which actually reinstalls all of docassemble's code. So
            we follow all the way through; I've got some docassemble code on my computer, it's being plugged into a
            volume into the docker container, and inside the docker container we're telling it to take all of that code
            from the volume: "reinstall it". In the same way that you would reinstall something like a normal program on
            your computer like Firefox or Chrome when you update it. I believe it's still installing and successfully
            installed! So once we've once we've installed it the very last command is this touch command, which we will
            run
            right now and that touch command just restarts docassemble such that it can use the new code
            so we press the on off button on docassemble um or the reset button and if we wait a few seconds we should
            um we'll wait a few seconds for seconds seconds for it to reload and we'll see that this last line will say
            only the last
            60 lines are shown and I don't actually know if I have 60 lines and logs on this particular um instance of
            docassemble because I just started it this morning, but if actually we can go up to something like access
            which is generally a lot longer and we'll see that it's showing a whole lot more lines than than it was
            before and we can see that the little bit of text that we changed there at the bottom is being shown.
            You've, we have now all of us y'all are (y'all are doing this too) have successfully made your first change
            to docassemle's core which is really neat.

        <h2>And so much more!</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">going past surface level Flask and git</li>
          <li class="fragment">Other systems in docassemble: pikepdf, sqlalchemy, redis, celery</li>
          <li class="fragment">You don't have to learn it all at once!</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">

          And this is just the beginning; there's a whole lot more you can do. um I've mentioned get and I mentioned
          flask both of those programs go a lot more in depth and there's a lot more detail to how they work um there
          are just tons of other different things in docassemble, like Pike PDF, SQLAlchemy, redis etc. But the good
          news is that even though there are all these different things you don't have to learn all of this at once like
          I said I've I've spent the last two and a half years doing this and I did not know anything when I started I
          knew none of these these programs listed on this screen right here but each time you do you go in you search
          for what you're looking for and you really closely read the few lines you want ignore everything else,
          ignore as much as you can, And you learn those lines and you get a little bit more knowledge and then you come
          back again and you'll know a bit more docassemble.

        So I know I like I said this is a fire hose feel free to reach out on slack to either myself, Jonathan is always
        helpful with these sorts of things, I ask them questions about the internal code all the time so reach out on
        slack and go forth and hack remember everything that is in the GitHub source code is your kingdom thank you
